Hello world! I’ve been wanting to do this for a while, and today I’m finally starting my journey on Medium. I believe ideas grow when we share them, and I’m excited to put mine out into the world.

This is my very first post on Medium, and I couldn’t think of a better way to begin than by sharing something that truly inspired me: a book that changed how I think about AI — _Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch_ by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger.

> “This is one of the best sources for a programmer to become proficient in deep learning.” — Peter Norvig, Director of Research, Google

**Why this book?**

People usually think Deep Learning as the exclusive domain of math and for big tech companies. In contrary to this mindset, this book shows that it’s totally wrong and proves that programmers just comfortable with Python could easily achieve state-of-the-art results in deep learning with little math background, small amounts of data, and minimal code.

> “This book simply and practically demystifies deep learning using a hands-on approach.” — Curtis Langlotz, Director, Center for AI in Medicine and Imaging, Standford University

**What makes it special?**

*   It starts with **real projects first** (computer vision, natural language processing, tabular modeling, recommendation systems, and much more)
*   **Explains complex concepts simply** that perfectly suited for readers with experience in programming but not in machine learning.
*   Encourages a **hands-on mindset**: code first, understand deeply as you go.
*   Shows that **AI is for everyone**, not just PhDs.

**Why software doesn’t matter?**

Although this book guides us to work on projects using fastai and PyTorch, the authors recommend we don’t need to focus too much on programming languages, frameworks, and tools, and try to focus on what really matters is learning the deep learning foundations and techniques properly. fastai written to help people using code that as clearly as possible, expresses the concepts that you need to learn. Last but not least, the library **facilitates fast prototyping**, allowing us to determine the suitability of models for continued development in our projects.

**What we will learn?**

After finish reading, you’ll be **able to train models with impressive results** across some of the most exciting areas of AI today:

*   **Computer Vision** — from classifying pet breeds to detecting and locating objects in an image.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — like analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews or building your own language models.
*   **Tabular Data** — handling everything from sales prediction to time series forecasting.
*   **Collaborative Filtering** — the engine behind personalized recommendations (think of Netflix or Spotify).

You’ll also learn how to:

*   Roll out your models into the real world.
*   Look under the hood of deep learning models, so you don’t just use — you improve them.
*   Employ cutting-edge techniques that deliver real-world impact.
*   Implement research papers, bringing the latest innovations straight into your projects.

All the essential building blocks of modern deep learning would also be presented and dug in, including (_allowed me to preserve everything exactly as it’s laid out in the book_):

*   Affine functions and nonlinearities
*   Parameters and activations
*   Random initialization and transfer learning
*   SGD, Momentum, Adam, and other optimizers
*   Convolutions
*   Batch normalization
*   Dropout
*   Data augmentation
*   Weight decay
*   ResNet and DenseNet architectures
*   Image classification and regression
*   Embeddings
*   Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
*   Segmentation
*   U-Net
*   And much more!

**Wrapping up**

I encourage anyone interested in AI to explore **Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch**, as it’s one of the most practical and inspiring books to the field. If you’ve already read it, I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

_If this is your first time hearing about it, the book is available here:_ [_Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch_](https://amzn.to/46CvX95)_._

As I continue this writing journey, I’ll be sharing more insights from the books, tools, and ideas that shape my work. Thank you for joining me at the start — I’m excited to see where this journey leads and to exchange thoughts and experiences along the way.
